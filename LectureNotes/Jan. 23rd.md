### Wicked Characteristics

- No definitive formulation
- No stopping rule
- Solutions not ture-or-false, just good-or-bad
- Solutions to wicked problems often only have one chance for success



### Specifications are comprised of 

- Functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements



### Specs describe what to do (but now how to do it)

- A perfect implementation is useless if it solves the wrong problem
- it is difficult to create specs that are:
  - Complete
  - Consistent
  - Precise 
  - Concise



### Specifications matter

- A specification:
  - Connects customer and engineer.
  - Ensures parts of the impelemenations work together.
  - Defines the correctness of the implementation.


- Therefore, everyone must understand the spec.
  - designers, developers, testers, managers, ops, customers...
  - Good specification is essential for success.



### Elicitation

- Required functioanlity: what the software should do
- Quality attrivutes: desired characteristics
- Design constraints: customer-specified limits
- Environmental assumptions: assumed contest
- Preferences
  - Priority rankings of requirements



### User stories

- Main form of input to a development team.
  - Product owners heavily involved in story creation.
  - Concretizes task, so dev team can push product owners for extra information if needed.
  - Encourages concrete collaboration between stakeholders.
- Goal is to decrease uncertainty between product owner expectations and development team understanding.
- Captures both the expected functionalityâ€¦(***more to write***)
- Properties: 
  - **I**ndependent
  - **N**egotiable
  - **V**aluable
  - **E**stimable
  - **S**mall
  - **T**estable
